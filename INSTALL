INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

INSTALLING ON POSIX COMPATIBLE SYSTEMS

* Install the dependencies:
  * Sun Java JDK 7
  * Scala 2.11: On OS X, it's easiest to install via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/): `brew install scala`
  * MySQL: Again, easiest to install via Homebrew: `brew install mysql`

* Edit the file bin/exports.sh (and optionally
  etherpad/bin/etherpad.default) and change the paths to
  match your system.

* Run bin/build.sh

* Run contrib/scripts/setup-mysql-db.sh

* Copy etherpad/etc/etherpad.localdev-default.properties to etherpad/etc/etherpad.local.properties
* Edit etherpad/etc/etherpad.local.properties and set
   etherpad.superUserEmailAddresses
       Example: etherpad.superUserEmailAddresses = name1@example.com,name2@example.com
   topdomains
       Example: topdomains = yourhostname.com,localhost

* You can now run etherpad via bin/run.sh.  Wait for the HTTP server to start
  listening, then visit http://localhost:9000.

* Create an account in development
  * Go through the sign up flow.  At this point, you will have created an
    account, but it needs to be validated.  If this were production, you would
    go to your email to click a link in a verification email, but since your
    development environment does not send email, we will resort to haxx.
  * Inspect the `email_signup` table in MySQL and find the row with your email
    address.  Note the token.
  * Visit http://localhost:9000/ep/account/validate-email?email=YOUR_EMAIL&token=TOKEN
  * Hurrah, you now have an account!

* If you want emoji support go to https://github.com/github/gemoji/tree/master/images/emoji/unicode
  and copy the images into etherpad/src/static/img/emoji/unicode/
