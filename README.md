# About Whackpad
Whackpad is a community fork of the Hackpad web-based realtime wiki, based on the open source EtherPad collaborative document editor, which again is a fork of etherpad.

As Hackpad had been unmaintained by Dropbox since 2015, we decided to create a fork to allow contributions to be gathered to keep the codebase alive. If you wish to join the community, please join us on #hackpad on #freenode or #whackpad:chat.weho.st on [Matrix/Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/whackpad:chat.weho.st).
