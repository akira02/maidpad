<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.</p>

<h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Any information gathered by Hackpad is used to improve the Hackpad experience, and is not shared or sold to any third parties, except as expressly provided for in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.</p>

<p>Hackpad uses third party analytics providers such as Google Analytics or Mixpanel to collect usage data about the service.  In these cases some data may be shared with these providers.</p>

<p>Hackpad reserves the right to view private hackpads for the purposes of fixing bugs and addressing customer support requests. This will only be done when necessary and this content will never be shared with anyone else.</p>

<p>All content that users store in "anyone with a link" or "invite only" hackpads belongs to the user who added the content.   Content added to public pads also belongs to the contributing user unless the particular page explicitly states otherwise (by specifying a license such as a http://creativecommons.org/ license).  Content in company hackpad domains belongs strictly to the company which registered the subdomain.</p>

<h2>Our Commitment To Data Security</h2>
<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We believe in protecting your information just as we would want our information protected.</p>

<p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Hackpad will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>

<h2>Notifications</h2>
<p>It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to our users via e-mail notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on the Hackpad website, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Hackpad reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users.</p>

<h2>Child Protection</h2>
We do not offer services to, or target, persons under the age of 13. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we will purge any information we receive from people we believe to be children under 13 from our database and cancel the corresponding accounts.

<h2>How To Contact Us</h2>
Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please send us e-mail at support at hackpad dot com.
